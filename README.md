## Evaluation and Testing
This is a chatbot that focuses on the conversational realm.

This chatbot is tightly focused on conversational topics, and based on what you type into the conversation, it will answer based on keywords, closely fitting the keywords you type in, but not able to answer substantively and effectively based on what you type in.
